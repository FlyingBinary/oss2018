### Who should I ask for help?
Please go to the venue reception desk, if they can't help you, they will direct you to a member of the summit team.

If you would like to email before or during the event please contact info@opensecsummit.org or get intouch via [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/os-summit/shared_invite/enQtMzY4NTk4MzYxNDExLTZjMDFlNDc5YTBkNDU1ZWM5NjM2MDNlZjI0Njc5MDc1NDljOGZjMjliYzNkOTA3OWEyMzczMzI2MjgyYzZlMzc)
